# repo-template

This repository is a template for all my GitHub repos created after 21/04/2024. It contains the boilerplate, that I used to frequently paste into new projects.

> [!WARNING]  
> As of 23/04/2024, all repositories created using a template come with a weird label that's impossible to turn off.

>
> There is already a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/15900) regarding this topic, so GitHub should roll out an option to turn off the label pretty quickly.
>
> If you want to create a repo using this template, without the label, you can always do it manually:
>
> `git clone https://github.com/Khenziii/repo-template`
>
> `cd repo-template`
>
> `rm -rf .git`
>
> `git init`
>
> After those steps, you can create a new repo, specify the remote & rename the folder to use the template in a brand-new, not associated repo.

### Wouldn't it be better, to create a .github repo, instead of a template like this?

I've heard about the .github repo, but decided not to use it, as it can create a lot of confusion. I prefer to always include essential files (such as LICENSE) directly in the project.
